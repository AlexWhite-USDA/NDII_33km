# NDII_33km

Google Colab notebook to quickly compute water-masked Landsat Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) in 1- to 33-km-diameter circles for user-input geographic location, date range, and cloud cover percentage. Outputs include an interactive NDII time series plot, interactive map of Landsat NDII overlaid on high-resolution visible imagery at the area of interest, and downloadable data files in TXT format. NAIP image availability, DN time series, and map layers are also shown at the input point. The notebook was used to assess the spatial representativeness of National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites throughout the US, for surrounding regions, to support SMAP soil moisture validation in 33-km domains (Ayres et al. [2021](https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3121206)).
